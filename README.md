TUIOjs
======

Javascript TUIO client library.

This library uses a connector to receive the TUIO data. Currently,
there are two connectors available:

* [npTuioClient](http://github.com/fajran/npTuioClient) based
  connector. Check it's project page to see how it works.

* Stomp based connector. This connector uses XHR to get events from a
  [Stomp](http://stomp.codehaus.org/) server.
